Codewars

This repository contains sample codewars exercises that I am doing during my training, each folder contains a problem, and the js file contains several ways to solve it. If you are going through a training using codewars, you should try to resolve the problem yourself, before taking a look here.
Feel free to navigate around, and propose improvements. :)
